explanation in src code:
/* Common timeouts are special timeouts that are handled as queues rather than
 * in the minheap.  This is more efficient than the minheap if we happen to
 * know that we're going to get several thousands of timeout events all with
 * the same timeout value.
 *
 * Since all our timeout handling code assumes timevals can be copied,
 * assigned, etc, we can't use "magic pointer" to encode these common
 * timeouts.  Searching through a list to see if every timeout is common could
 * also get inefficient.  Instead, we take advantage of the fact that tv_usec
 * is 32 bits long, but only uses 20 of those bits (since it can never be over
 * 999999.)  We use the top bits to encode 4 bites of magic number, and 8 bits
 * of index into the event_base's aray of common timeouts.
 */

32bit usec:
1)low 20bits: usec for struct timeval
2)up  4bits : magic indicate the event is common_timeout
3)middle 8bit:indate queue idx in the common_timeout queues,max is 256
